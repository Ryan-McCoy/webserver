# Ryan McCoy's Simple Web Server

An incredibly simple, currently also incredibly insecure, web server I wrote using libmicrohttpd and C. It will serve whatever files are in the current working directory when it is ran.

## Building

Just run `make`, assuming GNU Make and GCC are installed, as well as libmicrohttpd.
